Parkinson’s disease is a slowly progressive \\nneurological condition, characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Dementia has been \\nreported to occur in approximately 20%-60% of individuals with  Parkinson’s disease and is more likely to be present in \\nolder individuals or in those with more severe or advanc ed disease. The dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease \\nis characterized by cognitive and moto r slowing, executive dysfunction and impairment in memory retrieval. Declining \\ncognitive performance in individuals with Parkinson’s disease is frequently exacerbated by depression. Findings on \\nphysical examination include the characteristic abnormal motor signs of resting tremor, evidence of slowness and poverty of movement (such as micrographia), or muscular rigidity and loss of associated movements. At autopsy, \\nneuronal loss and Lewy bodies are evident in the substantia ni gra. There are a number of  syndromes that manifest \\nwith dementia, Parkinsonian movement disorders, and additional neurological features (e.g., progressive supranuclear \\npalsy, olivopontocerebellar degeneration, and Vascular Dementia). Some individuals with Parkinson’s disease and \\ndementia are found at autopsy to have coexisting neuropathology indicative of Alzheimer’s disease or of diffuse Lewy \\nbody disease.'),\n",

Rivastigmine for dementia associated with Park inson's disease. N Engl J Med. 2004;351:2509-18 \\n \\nBACKGROUND: Cholinergic deficits are prominent in patients who have dementia associated with \\nParkinson's disease. We investigated the effects of the dual cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine in such patients. METHODS: Patients in whom mild-to-moderate dementia developed at least 2 years after they received a \\nclinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 3 to 12 mg of \\nrivastigmine per day for 24 weeks. Primary efficacy va riables were the scores for the cognitive subscale of \\nthe Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-\\nClinician's Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). Secondary clinical outcomes were the scores for \\nthe Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative  Study-Activities of Daily Living, the 10-item Neuropsychiatric \\nInventory, the Mini-Mental State Examination, Cognitiv e Drug Research power of attention tests, the Verbal \\nFluency test, and the Ten Point Clock-Drawing test. RESULTS: A total of 541 patients were enrolled, and 410 completed the study. The outcomes were better \\namong patients treated with rivastigmine than among those who received placebo; however, the differences \\nbetween these two groups were moderate and similar to those reported in trials of rivastigmine for \\nAlzheimer's disease. Rivastigmine-treated patients had a mean improvement of 2.1 points in the score for \\nthe 70-point ADAS-cog, from a baseline score of 23.8, as compared with a 0.7-point worsening in the placebo group, from a baseline score of 24.3 (P<0.001). Clinically meaningful improvements in the scores \\nfor the ADCS-CGIC were observed in 19.8 percent of patients in the rivastigmine group and 14.5 percent of \\nthose in the placebo group, and clinically meaningful worsening was observed in 13.0 percent and 23.1 percent, respectively (mean score at 24 weeks, 3.8 and 4.3, respectively; P=0.007). Significantly better \\noutcomes were seen with rivastigmine  with respect to all se condary efficacy variab les. The most frequent \\nadverse events were nausea (affecting 29.0 percent of patients in the rivastigmine group and 11.2 percent \\nof those in the placebo group, P<0.001), vomiting (1 6.6 and 1.7 percent, P<0.001), and tremor (10.2 and 3.9 \\npercent, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this placebo-controlled study, ri vastigmine was associated with moderate improvements \\nin dementia associated with Parkinson's disease but also with higher rates of nausea, vomiting, and tremor. \"),\n",

However she has the following concerns about these analyses \\n \\n\\x83 An assumption underlying the use of an analysis of covariance (used in \\nthis instance for the primary efficacy analysis of the ADAS-Cog) is that \\nthe data be normally distributed.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data2/ZAIRYEDJ6SHNYMBVPJMCBULE2HL7HMRV.pdf', 'page': 46}, page_content='Dr Zhang tested the residuals for the analysis of covariance model used fo r the ADAS-Cog analysis with the \\nWilk-Shapiro test; the hypothesis of normality of the residuals was \\nrejected (p-values of 0.0072 for Week 16, and < 0.0072 for Week 24). Dr \\nZhang therefore used a non-parametric method, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, for the analysis of the ADAS-Cog and demonstrated statistically significant differences favoring Exelon® over placebo at both Weeks 16 and 24 (p < 0.005 at both timepoints) \\n \\n\\x83 Another assumption underlying the use of an analysis of covariance \\nmodel to test for differences between the drug and placebo groups is that of a constant regression relationship between the 2 treatment groups; if that assumption is violated it is indicative of an interaction between the \\ntreatment groups and independent variable (i.e., the baseline value) and \\nthis interaction renders difficult the interpretation of the final treatment effect due to the drug. Dr Zhang tested the heterogeneity of the slopes for the 2 treatment groups for the ADAS-Cog at Weeks 16 and 24 in the intent-to-treat plus retrieved dropouts population; while the slopes at Week 16 were similar, those at Week 24 were statistically significantly \\ndifferent, as indicated by the table below. Therefore, if the analysis of \\ncovariance model is relied on to predict the treatment effect due to the drug, the drug will be underestimated at low baseline values and \\noverestimated at high baseline values.

Although a statistically significant treatment effect was not seen in women alone on the gender-based subgroup analysis for the ADCS-CGIC per formed by the \\nAgency Biometrics Reviewer, the effect size s (and variance) in that subgroup for \\nthe mean change from baseline to W eek 24 in ADAS-Cog score and mean \\nADCS-CGIC score were similar to thos e seen in men, while fewer women than \\nmen were enrolled in the study. The implications of the results of this st udy in the context of the new claim (i.e., \\n“treatment of mild to moderate dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease”) \\nsought by the sponsor in this Supplemental  Application are discussed later in the \\nreview. 7.6.2 Safety Of Exelon® \\nThe safety data for this study indicate that  the adverse event profile of Exelon® in \\nthe study population was largely similar to that seen in clinical trials with \\nAlzheimer’s Disease, in that there was a distinctly higher frequency of nausea, \\nvomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia in thos e exposed to Exelon® than in those \\nexposed to placebo. Of special relevance to a population with Parkinson’s Disease, was the \\nobservation that tremor (which was not further characterized) was recorded as a \\ntreatment-emergent adverse event in about  10% of those received Exelon® and \\n4% of those who received placebo in this st udy (in the controlled clinical trials of \\nExelon® that were conducted prior to its approval for Alzheimer’s Disease, \\ntremor was seen in about 4% of  those who received Exelon® and 1% of those \\nwho received placebo). Several other adver se events that may conceivably have \\nbeen linked to a worsening in Parkinson’ s Disease were also more frequent in \\nthose treated with Exelon® than in those treated with placebo, but their incidence \\nin the Exelon®-treated group was lower than that of tremor. However, changes in \\nUPDRS total motor scores, probably a more  objective measure of change in the \\nmotor manifestations of Parkinson’s Disease than the incidence of treatment-\\nemergent adverse events, showed no meaningful difference between treatment groups.

A meeting was held with the sponsor on May 18, 2005, at which the results of \\nStudy 2311 (EXPRESS Study) were discussed in outline and on a preliminary basis, in the context of a sponsor proposal  to expand the current indication for \\nExelon® to include “the treatment of mild  to moderate dementia  associated with \\nParkinson’s Disease.” \\n \\nThe following is a summary of the salient views conveyed by the sponsor’s team at that meeting. \\x83 The entity of dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease (as exemplified by \\nthe patients enrolled in the EXPRESS Study) is linked to distinctive \\nneuropathological findings (i.e., widespread Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites), with more recent publications strongly suggesting that the contribution of  co-existing Alzheimer’s-type neuropathological changes (e.g., senile plaques and \\nneurofibrillary tangles) to the dementia are minor \\n \\n\\x83 A cholinergic deficiency state is the basis for dementia associated with \\nParkinson’s Disease, just as with Alzheimer’s Disease  \\n \\n\\x83 The population enrolled in the EXPRESS trial was distinct from that enrolled in \\nthe pre-approval clinical trials of rivastigmine in Alzheimer’s Disease (and was \\nactually excluded from those trials) \\n \\n\\x83 Although patients enrolled in the EXPRESS trial were not selected based on \\nthose neuropsychological deficits that, according to the DSM IV definition of \\n“Dementia Due To Parkinson’s Disease,” (294. 1) are distinctive for that disorder \\n(i.e., “cognitive and motor slowing, executive dysfunction, and impairment in \\nmemory retrieval”), selecting patients based on the extent of such deficits is unlikely to help differentiate them from patients with Alzheimer’s Disease \\n \\n\\x83 The results of the EXPRESS Study are sufficiently robust for that study alone to \\nbe the basis for the expansion of the current claim to include dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease, especially since the mechanism by which rivastigmine may have its effect in that condition and in Alzheimer’s Disease may be the same.

In addition, the clinical course of the \\nplacebo arm and the size of the effect seen with rivastigmine in the EXPRESS \\ntrial were no different from similar observations in pre-approval efficacy trials of rivastigmine in Alzheimer’s Disease. These observations call into question how distinct the patients in the EXPRESS trial were from those enrolled in the pre-approval Alzheimer’s Disease trials, and whether any effect of rivastigmine on performance that was seen in the former  study was mediated through its effects \\non co-existing Alzheimer’s Disease. \\x83 DSM-IV is a standard reference manual containing diagnostic criteria for the \\nentire spectrum of psychiatric and neuropsychiatric disorders, including “Dementia Due To Parkinson’s Disease” (294.1). In the EXPRESS Study, \\npatients with dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease were enrolled based \\non their having dementia, but without the more distinctive cognitive deficits described in DSM-IV, thus raising the possibility that the appropriate diagnostic criteria for that entity may not have been applied in that study. \\x83 The sponsor is currently seeking a claim for the use of rivastigmine in dementia \\nassociated with Parkinson’s Disease based on a single study (i.e., EXPRESS). While the sponsor considers the results of that study to be robust, the Division has generally required that evidence for the efficacy of a drug in a distinct clinical entity be replicated, and a second study would, therefore, ordinarily be required to address the claim that the sponsor is currently pursuing  \\n \\nThe Division was of the view that the entity of dementia  associated with \\nParkinson’s Disease should be discussed at  a meeting of the Peripheral and \\nCentral Nervous Systems Drugs Adviso ry Committee. The sponsor proposed \\nsubmitting a Supplemental NDA based on efficacy data from the EXPRESS \\nStudy only, with a request for a standard review and the possibility of holding a \\nmeeting of the Advisory Committee duri ng the course of that review was \\ndiscussed. The Division was, very shortly after the m eeting, to discuss internally whether it \\nwould be prepared to file a Supplemental NDA  for rivastigmine in the treatment of \\ndementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease, based on efficacy data derived \\nfrom the EXPRESS Study al one, given the proposed common mechanism of \\naction of rivastigmine in both dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease and \\nAlzheimer’s Disease, and was to inform t he sponsor of its view shortly. On May 24, 2005, the Division informed the s ponsor that it would accept the filing \\nof a Supplemental NDA for Exelon® in t he treatment of demen tia associated with \\nParkinson’s Disease based on the results of the EXPRESS Study alone and that \\nreview of  that application would include a discussion with the Peripheral and \\nCentral Nervous Systems Drugs Advisory  Committee during the 10-month review \\nperiod.'),\n",

Parkinson’s disease is a slowly \\nprogressive neurological condition, characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Dementia has been reported to occur in approximately 20%-60% of individuals with Parkinson’s disease and \\nis more likely to be present in older individuals or in those with more severe or advanced disease. The dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease is char acterized by cognitive and motor slowing, executive \\ndysfunction and impairment in memory retrieval. Dec lining cognitive performance in individuals with \\nParkinson’s disease is frequently exacerbated by depr ession. Findings on physical examination include the \\ncharacteristic abnormal motor signs of resting tremor , evidence of slowness and poverty of movement (such \\nas micrographia), or muscular rigidity and loss of associated movements. At autopsy, neuronal loss and \\nLewy bodies are evident in the substantia nigra. Ther e are a number of syndromes that manifest with \\ndementia, Parkinsonian movement disorders, and additional neurological features (e.g., progressive \\nsupranuclear palsy, olivopontocerebellar degeneration, and Vascular Dementia). Some individuals with \\nParkinson’s disease and dementia are found at autopsy to have coexisting neuropathology indicative of \\nAlzheimer’s disease or of diffuse Lewy body disease. A medical practitioner can apply these criteria easily. 11.2 Appropriateness Of Using The ADAS-Cog And ADCS-ADL As \\nOutcome Measures In Dementia Associated With Parkinson’s Disease  \\nAn expert report prepared by Philip D.

Consequently the claimants \\nwere transferred from the Federal Civil Service retirement \\nsystem to the Massachusetts State retirement system along \\nwith the employees' and employer's contributions to the \\nFederal system. In addition to the transfer of contributions which took \\nplace, the claimants believe that they should be reimbursed \\nfor other costs arising from their reentry into the \\nMassachusetts State retirement system after the intervening \\nperiod when they were mistakenly under Federal retirement \\nsystem. The reimbursement requested includes two elements of \\ninterest charged the claimants in order to fully restore \\ntheir Massachusetts State retirement coverage. At the \\ncommencement of the interim period under Federal Civil \\nService retirement, the claimants withdrew the balance of \\ntheir contributions then accumulated in the Massachusetts \\nState retirement system. All of the claimants request \\nreimbursement of interest that would have accrued on this \\nbalance during the interim period had it not been withdrawn, \\nand which they indicate the Massachusetts system requires \\nthem to pay. The second element is sought by six of the \\nclaimants who believe they are entitled to reimbursement of \\ninterest on additional contributions that they would have \\npaid into the Massachusetts State retirement system had they \\nnot left that system during the interim period. In addition, two of the claimants through their \\nattorney request the difference between their payroll deduc- \\ntions (7 percent of their pay) for Federal Civil Service \\nretirement during the interim period and what they say their \\ncontributions to the Massachusetts State retirement system \\n(5 percent of their pay) would have been if they had con- \\ntinued that coverage uninterrupted. These two claimants \\nalso ask that their attorney fees for presenting the claims \\nbe paid.\"),\n",

As to the irrevocability of elections to \\nremain under state retirement coverage pursuant to the \\nNational Guard Technicians Act, the Civil Service Commission \\npublished the following information dated April 30, 1969: \\nR(l) * * * A technician\\'s election to remain \\nin a State retirement plan is irrevocable and \\ncannot be changed later so that service \\ncredit can be allowed under the Civil Service \\nRetirement System. \" \\nFederal Personnel Manual Supplement 831-1, Subchapter S3, \\nparagraph S3-3, Installment 20, April 30, 1969. This pro- \\nvision was reissued December 10, 1971. Thus, as the Com- \\nmission officially advised the National Guard Personnel \\nOfficer in the 1977 letter it was the Commission\\'s position \\nthat a technician\\'s choice to remain under a state retire- \\nment system was irrevocable and that conversion to Federal \\nCivil Service retirement was unauthorized, even after a \\nbreak in service and reemployment with the state. It appears that the corrective action taken to return \\nthe claimants to the state retirement system with concurrent \\ntransfer of funds to that system was all the action the law \\nallows to correct the error. Although we have not been fur- \\nnished a full accounting of the transfer of funds from the \\nFederal Civil Service Retirement Fund to the Massachusetts \\nsystem, we may assume that the difference between the 7 per- \\ncent Federal contribution and the 5 percent Massachusetts \\ncontribution was used either to pay interest on the late \\ndeposit to the Massachusetts fund or was refunded to the \\nemployees. There is no authority we are aware of under \\nand attorney fees. However, the question of whether interesz \\nmay be paid on the amounts erroneously paid into the Federal \\nCivil Service retirement system for the period they were \\ndeposited in the Civil Service Retirement Fund is a matter \\nfor determination by the Office of Personnel Management. That office may be willing to consider further the question \\nof appropriate interest payments with respect to the amounts \\nerroneously paid into and held in the fund. , which we could authorize payment of the claims for interest \\n-4- '),\n",

The legislation would for four years provide congressional direction to implementation of the\\nEndangered Species Act, restore operational flexibility for California water projects, and provide\\nreasonable protection to threatened species. Specifically, the legislation would modify\\nreasonable and prudent alternatives in the biological opinions for the operations of the CVP and\\nthe SWP issued by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine\\nFisheries Service. “Our streets are flooding, our food banks are going empty, and unemployment in the\\nValley is nearing 20%. California’s water system is broken. We can fix it,” said Costa. “This commonsense legislation would bring needed flexibility to California’s water\\npolicy. If this bill becomes law, our Valley would receive an additional 200,000 acre feet\\nof water that could be put to good use this summer. This bill means more water, more\\njobs, and a stronger economy for the San Joaquin Valley. It is time to put aside our\\npolitical labels and get to work for the people of the valley by sending this bill to the\\nPresident\\'s desk.”\\n  \\nThe legislation is supported by numerous Valley water districts, including Westlands Water\\nDistrict and Friant Water Authority. Tom Birmingham, General Manager of Westlands Water\\nDistrict, added, \"We are on track to have one of the wettest years on record in California,\\nand farmers on the Westside of the San Joaquin Valley have been told that they can\\nexpect to receive slightly more than half of their normal water supplies.

WASHINGTON –\\xa0Today, U.S. Representative Mike Quigley (D-IL) applauded the inclusion of\\nthe bipartisan Jobs Originating through Launching Travel (JOLT) Act in the Senate’s\\ncomprehensive immigration reform package. “I’m thrilled my colleagues in the Senate recognize the value of the JOLT Act and have made it\\na priority within comprehensive immigration reform,” said Rep. Quigley . “Updating America’s\\nvisa travel protocol will increase opportunities for international tourists, create jobs, and drive\\nvaluable tourism dollars to cities across the country, including Chicago. Modernizing the Visa\\nWaiver Program specifically will strengthen our national security and enhance relationships with\\nimportant allies like Poland, who have been denied visa-free travel because of outdated\\npolicies.”\\n  \\nQuigley, along with Rep. Joe Heck (R-NV), reintroduced the JOLT Act earlier this year. The bill\\nincludes a key provision identical to Quigley’s Visa Waiver Program Enhanced Security and\\nReform Act , which would allow for expansion of\\nthe Visa Waiver Program (VWP).

We’ve en\\xad\\nhanced our online S URVEY search engine. We’ve made our articles \\nmore Web friendly. And we’ve continued to publish BEA Brief\\xad\\nings and Research Spotlights that explain important services and \\nresearch in a less technical fashion. We look forward to the new year. There are many initiatives \\nunderway that will result in new prod ucts and servic es from the \\nBureau of Economic Analysis. As alwa ys, the SURVEY will be a \\nprime tool in communicating these developments to our users. We apprec iate your comments and questions.'),\n",

The midpoint on the  base chart between Stevns Lighthouse and Falsterbo Point is \\nnot Point 6: again the datum discrepancies between the base chart and the Declaration chart. '),\n",

SUMMARY \\nThe northern and southern limits of the TSB are based on the equidistance principle, that \\nis, the segment from the northern terminus to Lous Flak, and the portion joining 4 -5-6. Points 5 and 6 are equidistant points. The remainder of the TSB was established through negotiation apparently with little concern with the coastal configuration. The TSB from the northern terminus to Lous Flak is an example where the presence of an offshore island (Ven) was ignored and the equidistant line was delimited between the respective mainlands.

See Borrero v. City of Chicago,  456 F.3d 698, 701-02 (7th Cir. 20 06) (explaining that whether a \\nmotion filed within the time frame contempl ated by Rule 59(e) should be analyzed \\nunder Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  depends on the \\nsubstance  of the motion, not on the timing or label affixed to it).

For your protection, you should be aware that as \"owner-builder\" you are the responsible \\nparty of record on such a permit. Buildi ng permits are not required to be signed by \\nproperty owners unless they ar e personally performing their own work. If your work is \\nbeing performed by someone other than yourself, you may protect yourself from possible \\nliability if that person applies for t he proper permit in his or her name. Contractors are required by law to be licens ed and bonded by the Stat e of California. They also are required by law to put thei r license number on all permits for which they \\napply. If you plan to do your own work, with the exception of various trades that you plan to \\nsubcontract, you should be aware of the fo llowing information for your benefit and \\nprotection. If you employ or otherwise engage any person ot her than your immediate family, and the \\nwork (including materials and other costs) is $500 or more for the enti re project, and such \\npersons are not licensed as contractors or subcontractors in t he State of California, then \\nyou may be an employer. If you are an employer, you must r egister with the state and \\nfederal government as an employ er and you are subject to several obligations including \\nstate and federal income tax withholding, federal social security taxes, workers\\' \\ncompensation insurance, disability insur ance costs, and unemployment compensation \\ncontributions. There may be financial risks for you if you do not ca rry these obligations, \\nand these risks are especially serious with res pect to workers\\' compensation insurance. For more specific information about your obligat ion under federal law, contact the Internal \\nRevenue Service (telephone number: 1-800-829-1040) and if you wish the Small Business \\nAdministration (telephone number: (619) 557-7250). For more specific information about your obligations under state law,  contact the Department of Indu strial Relations, Division of \\nWorkers\\' Compensation (telephone number:  (619) 767-2086). If the structure is intended for sale, property owners who are not licens ed contractors are \\nallowed to perform their work personally or through their own employees, without a \\nlicensed contractor or subcontra ctor, only under limited conditions. A frequent practice of unlicensed persons profe ssing to be contractors is to secure an \\n\"owner-builder\" building permit, erroneously impl ying that the property owner is providing \\nhis or her own labor and materi als personally. There could be significant penalties for this \\npractice.'),\n",

The benchmark survey for this product was conducted in 2004, with \\nthe first followup wave occurring in late 2005/early 2006 (and r eported here). lThe purpose of the e-file product tracking research is to monitor User satisfaction with each e-file \\nform; to look for ways to increase usage among Non -Users ; and to provide IRS with quantitative data \\nand analysis to use in making policy decisions related to each product as IR S moves toward its 80% e-\\nfile usage goal. lFieldwork for this wave of the 990/990EZ Satisfaction Survey was started in late December 2005 but \\ncompleted mainly in January 2006 . Interviewing was conducted via telephone from Russell ’s national \\nfield facility in Wayne, NJ, with respondents drawn from IRS lists of 990/990EZ Users and Non -Users. lThe sample consisted of 634 interviews conducted among 990/990EZ preparers... n130with Users of 990/990EZ e-file(with half external Preparers answering for client organizations); and …\\nn504with Eligible Non -Users of 990/990EZ e-file(with half also being external Preparers). Sampling Notes : 1) the IRS User list was too small to yield the desired ending sample of 500 –as the program grows, future User samples will \\nincrease; 2) the IRS ’s User and Non -User lists separated 990 from 990EZ usage, so respondents were a sked which they use and then to talk about \\nthat specific product.

The goal of the ETV Program is to further environmental protection\\nby substantially accelerating the acceptance and use of improved and cost-effective technologies. ETV seeks to\\nachieve this goal by  providing high quality, peer reviewed data on technology performance to those involved in the\\ndesign, distribution, financing, permitting, purchase, and use of environmental technologies. ETV works in partnership with recognized standards and testing organizations, stakeholder groups which consist of \\nbuyers, vendor organizations and permitters, and with the full participation of individual technology developers. The\\nprogram evaluates the performance of innovative technologies by developing test plans that are responsive to the\\nneeds of stakeholders, conducting field or laboratory tests (as appropriate), collecting and analyzing data, and\\npreparing peer reviewed reports. All evaluations are conducted in accordance with rigorous quality assurance\\nprotocols to ensure that data of known and adequate quality are generated and that the results are defensible. The Air Pollution Control Technology (APCT) program, one of 12 technology areas under ETV, is operated by the\\nResearch Triangle Institute (RTI), in cooperation with EPA’s National Risk Management Research Laboratory. APCT has recently evaluated the performance of paint overspray arrestors used primarily in the aerospace industry.

[Method 319 is part of the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants\\n(NESHAP) for Aerospace Manufacturing and Rework Facilities and was published in the Federal Register  on\\nMarch 27, 1998 (40 CFR Part 63).]  The protocol also includes requirements for quality management, quality\\nassurance,  procedures for product selection, auditing of the test laboratories, and test reporting format. Filtration efficiency is computed from aerosol concentrations measured upstream and downstream of an arrestor\\ninstalled in a laboratory test rig. The aerosol concentrations upstream and downstream of the arrestor are measured\\nwith an aerosol analyzer that simultaneously counts and sizes the particles in the aerosol stream. The aerosol\\nanalyzer covers the particle diameter size range from 0.3 to 10 µm in a series of contiguous sizing channels. Each\\nsizing channel covers a narrow range of particle diameters. By taking the ratio of the downstream to upstream counts\\non a channel by channel basis, the filtration efficiency is computed for each of the sizing channels. The following series of tests were performed at a face velocity of 120 fpm (0.61 m/s):\\nCThree arrestors were tested using a liquid-phase aerosol challenge,\\nCThree arrestors were tested using a solid-phase aerosol challenge,\\nCSix “no-filter” control tests (one performed prior to each arrestor test), \\nCOne high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter control test, and\\nCOne reference filter control test. TECHNOLOGY DESCRIPTION\\nThe Purolator D95084415, DMK80-4404, and PB2424 arrestor system consists of three filters. The  D95084415 is\\nan eight-pocket bag filter with nominal dimensions of 24 x 24 x 15 in. (0.61 x 0.61 x 0.38 m). It has a metal frame,\\nand the filter media is blue upstream and white downstream. Its label is white, ½  x 7 in. (1.27 x 17.8 cm)  in size,\\nand is affixed to the metal frame. The label includes the following information: Purolator Products Air Filtration\\nCompany, Model - D95084415K, Size - 24 x 24 x 15 in. (0.61 x 0.61 x 0.38 m), and an arrow indicating  flow\\ndirection. The DMK80-4404, Mark 80D, is a pleated panel filter with nominal dimensions of 24 x 24 x 4 in. (0.61 x 0.61 x\\n0.10 m). The filter media is blue with 22 pleats. Text imprinted on the cardboard frame includes the following\\ninformation: Purolator Pleated Filter, Mark 80D, Medium Efficiency Panel Air Filter, Purolator Products Air\\nFiltration Company, airflow direction, 24 x 24 x 4 in.

Forready comparison, the filtration efficiency requirements of the NESHAP are tabulated with the test results in Tables1 through 4. The test results indicate that the tested arrestor exceeded the requirements listed in Tables 1 and 2 forexisting sources and those listed in Tables 3 and 4 for new sources. The pressure drop across the tested arrestors at120 fpm (0.61 m/s) ranged from 0.22 to 0.26 in. H\\n2O (55 to 65 Pa) for the six arrestors tested . The APCT quality assurance officer has reviewed the test results and the quality control data and has concluded thatthe data quality objectives given in the generic verification protocol have been attained.This verification statement addresses two aspects of paint overspray arrestor performance: filtration efficiency andpressure drop. Users of this technology may wish to consider other performance parameters such as service life andcost when selecting a paint overspray arrestor for their use.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has created the Environmental Technology Verification (ETV)\\nProgram to facilitate the deployment of innovative or improved technologies through performance verification and\\ninformation dissemination. The ETV Program is intended to assist and inform those involved in the design,\\ndistribution, permitting, and purchase of environmental technologies. The U.S. EPA’s partner in the Air Pollution Control Technology (APCT) Program is Research Triangle Institute\\n(RTI). The APCT Program, with the full participation of the technology developer, develops plans, conducts tests,\\ncollects and analyzes data, and reports findings. The evaluations are conducted according to a rigorous protocol and\\nquality assurance and quality control oversight. The APCT Program verifies the performance of commercial-ready\\ntechnologies used to control air pollutant emissions, with an emphasis on technologies for controlling particulate\\nmatter, volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and hazardous air pollutants. The Program develops\\nstandardized verification protocols and test plans, conducts independent testing of technologies, and prepares\\nverification test reports and statements for broad dissemination. SECTION 2\\nVERIFICATION TEST DESCRIPTION\\nThe paint overspray arrestor was tested in accordance with the APCT “Generic Verification Protocol for Paint\\nOverspray Arrestors”1 and the “Test/QA Plan for Paint Overspray Arrestors.”2  This protocol incorporates all\\nrequirements of EPA Method 319:  Determination of Filtration Efficiency for Paint Overspray Arrestors. Method\\n3193 is part of the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Aerospace\\nManufacturing and Rework Facilities.4  The protocol also includes requirements for quality management, quality\\nassurance,  procedures for product selection, auditing of the test laboratories, and reporting format. Filtration efficiency was computed from aerosol concentrations measured upstream and downstream of an arrestor\\ninstalled in a laboratory test rig. The aerosol concentrations upstream and downstream of the arrestors were\\nmeasured with an aerosol analyzer that simultaneously counts and sizes the particles in the aerosol stream. The\\naerosol analyzer covered the particle diameter size range from 0.3 to 10 µm in a series of contiguous sizing channels. Each sizing channel covered a narrow range of particle diameters. For example, channel 1 may cover from 0.3 to 0.4\\nµm, channel 2 from 0.4 to 0.5 µm, and channel 15 from 7 to 10 µm. By taking the ratio of the downstream to\\nupstream counts on a channel by channel basis, the filtration efficiency was computed for each of the sizing channels. The upstream and downstream aerosol measurements were made while a test aerosol was injected  into the air stream\\nupstream of the arrestor [ambient aerosol is removed with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters on the inlet of\\nthe test rig]. This test aerosol spanned the particle size range from 0.3 to 10 µm and provided a sufficient upstream\\nconcentration in each of the sizing channels to allow accurate calculation of filtration efficiencies up to 99%. The following series of tests were performed at a face velocity of 120 fpm (0.61 m/s):\\nCThree arrestors were tested using a liquid-phase aerosol challenge,\\nCThree arrestors were tested using a solid-phase aerosol challenge,'),\n",

The PB2424s were in stock and an order was placed to ship these\\nfilters from the manufacturing plant to the corporate office and then to RTI. The other two items were ordered by a\\nthird  party, manufactured, then diverted to RTI. The manufacturer supplied the test laboratory with 18 arrestors;\\nfrom these 18, the test laboratory randomly selected six for testing. SECTION 3\\nDESCRIPTION OF ARRESTOR\\nThe Purolator D95084415, DMK80-4404, and PB2424 arrestor system consists of three filters.

The system operates at positive pressure to\\nminimize infiltration of room air. To mix the test aerosol with the air stream, an orifice plate and mixing baffle were located immediately downstream\\nof the aerosol injection point and upstream of the test arrestor. An identical orifice plate and mixing baffle were\\nadded after the 180° bend. The latter downstream orifice served two purposes. It straightened out the flow after\\ngoing around the bend, and it mixed any aerosol that penetrated the air cleaning device. Mixing the penetrating\\naerosol with the air stream is necessary to obtain a representative downstream aerosol measurement. AIRFLOW\\nAirflow was measured with a 4 in. (0.1 m) ID American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) flow nozzle. The\\nnominal velocity through the arrestor was computed by dividing the volumetric flow by the nominal face area of the\\ndevice. Airflow was manually controlled by a 14 in.\"),\n",

The selection of liquid- or solid-phase challenge\\naerosol particles is important because for some types of paint arrestors significantly different filtration efficiencies\\nwill be achieved depending upon the phase of the challenge aerosol particles. (This is due to particle \"bounce\"\\nassociated with solid-phase particles.) The liquid-phase challenge aerosol is oleic acid, a non-toxic, low-volatility\\nliquid. The solid-phase aerosol is potassium chloride (KCl) generated from an aqueous solution. KCl was selected as\\nthe solid-phase aerosol because of its relatively high water solubility, high deliquescence humidity (85% relative\\nhumidity), known crystalline structure (facilitates complete drying), and low toxicity. The KCl solution was prepared\\nby combining 0.66 lb (300 g ) of KCl with 0.035 ft3 (1 L) of distilled water. Both oleic acid and KCl are compatible\\nwith accurate measurement by the optical particle counter. The oleic acid or the KCl solution was nebulized using a two-fluid (air and liquid) air atomizing nozzle (Spray\\nSystems 1/4 J siphon spray nozzle) as illustrated in Figure A-1 (aerosol generation system). The nozzle was\\npositioned at the top of a 12 in.'),\n",

The tower\\nserved two purposes. It allowed the salt droplets to dry by providing an approximate 40 sec. mean residence time,\\nand it allowed larger-sized particles (of either KCl or oleic acid) to fall out of the aerosol. After generation, the\\naerosol passed through a TSI Model 3054 aerosol neutralizer (Kr-85 radioactive source) to neutralize any\\nelectrostatic charge on the aerosol (electrostatic charging is an unavoidable consequence of most aerosol-generation\\nmethods). The KCl solution or oleic acid was fed to the atomizing nozzle at 1.2 mL/min (4.2 x 10-5 ft3/min) by means of a\\npump. Varying the operating air pressure of the generator allows control of the mean diameter of the challenge\\naerosol. AEROSOL SAMPLING SYSTEM\\nThe aerosol sampling lines were 0.55 in.

This sequential sampling scheme was selected to minimize the effect of aerosol generator variability. Each sample was 2 minutes in duration. The sampling also included background upstream and downstream\\nmeasurements at the beginning and end of each test. The test sequence was as follows:\\n1.Warm up OPC and install proper sample tips for isokinetic sampling. 2.Install air cleaner test device and bring test duct to desired flow rate. 3.With the aerosol generator off, obtain five measurements of the upstream and downstream background\\nparticle counts. 4.Turn on the aerosol generator and allow it to run for a minimum of 10 minutes to stabilize. 5.After the stabilization period, obtain 10 upstream and 10 downstream particle counts using a repeated\\nupstream-downstream sampling sequence until 10 each are obtained. 6.Turn off the aerosol generator. Wait 10 minutes, then obtain five additional upstream and downstream\\nbackground measurements. CONTROL TESTS:\\nIn addition to evaluating the test arrestor, 0 and 100% penetration control tests and a reference filter control test were\\nconducted to ensure that reliable measurements are obtained. The 100% penetration test was a relatively stringent\\ntest of the adequacy of the overall duct, sampling, measurement and aerosol generation system. These tests were\\nperformed as normal penetration tests except that the paint arrestor was not used. A perfect system would yield a\\nmeasured penetration of 1 at all particle sizes. Deviations from 1 can occur due to particle losses in the duct,\\ndifferences in the degree of aerosol uniformity (i.e., mixing) at the upstream and downstream probes, and differences\\nin particle-transport efficiency in the upstream and downstream sampling lines. Results from the 100% penetration\\ntests were used during data analysis to correct penetration measurements obtained during the arrestor tests. The 0% penetration test was performed by using a HEPA filter rather than a paint arrestor. This test confirmed the\\nadequacy of the instrument response time and sample line lag. The 0% penetration test was performed on a monthly\\nbasis. The reference filter control test consisted of performing a solid-phase efficiency test on the same filter during each\\nETV test. The reference filter data from each test were compared to the original, baseline reference filter data to\\ndetermine if there was any substantial change in the test system between the tests.

However, the Anti-Homosexuality Bill of 2009 that has been introduced in the\\nParliament of Uganda takes this to a deadly extreme. This proposed legislation criminalizes\\nand punishes homosexuality, thereby endangering the lives of all Ugandans and threatening\\ntheir civil and human rights. This is outrageously discriminatory and deeply troubling. If it became law, the Anti-Homosexuality Bill would condemn HIV-positive citizens who engage\\nin consensual homosexual acts to death. It would also sentence those who engage in\\nconsensual homosexual acts to life imprisonment. LGBT citizens living abroad could be\\nextradited for acts committed outside Uganda and tried under this law, including those who are\\nalso dual citizens of Uganda and the United States. If you knew that a homosexual act had\\nbeen committed either in Uganda or by a Ugandan citizen, this would have to be reported to the\\nauthorities within 24 hours – failure to do so could result in a jail term of up to three years, even\\nif you are not a Ugandan citizen. Finally, the Anti-Homosexuality Bill requires that it takes\\nprecedence over any commitment to international agreements that recognize the rights of LGBT\\npersons. As a responsible member of the international community, the United States cannot sit\\nidly by as such a bill becomes law. This legislation would undermine the government of Uganda’s commitment to democracy at a\\nmost basic level, significantly damage its relations with the international community, and risk\\ninciting greater hate-motivated violence within Uganda itself. Furthermore, I am deeply\\nconcerned about the consequences that this bill would have on public health in Uganda as it\\nattempts to combat HIV/AIDS. The stigmatization of homosexual identity and behavior\\ncontinues to stymie efforts to fight HIV/AIDS in the United States and abroad.'),\n",

(4) Documentation. The petition for \\nremoval of conditions must be accom-panied by the following evidence: \\n(i) Evidence that a commercial enter-\\nprise was established by the alien. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to, Federal income tax returns; \\n(ii) Evidence that the alien invested \\nor was actively in the process of invest-ing the requisite capital. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to, an audited financial statement or other probative evidence; and \\n(iii) Evidence that the alien sus-\\ntained the actions described in para-graph (a)(4)(i) and (a)(4)(ii) of this sec-tion throughout the period of the alien’s residence in the United States. The alien will be considered to have sustained the actions required for re-moval of conditions if he or she has, in good faith, substantially met the cap-ital investment requirement of the statute and continuously maintained his or her capital investment over the two years of conditional residence. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to, bank statements, invoices, receipts, contracts, business licenses, Federal or State income tax returns, and Federal or State quarterly tax statements. (iv) Evidence that the alien created \\nor can be expected to create within a reasonable time ten full-time jobs for qualifying employees. In the case of a ‘‘troubled business’’ as defined in 8 CFR 204.6(j)(4)(ii), the alien entre-preneur must submit evidence that the commercial enterprise maintained the number of existing employees at no less than the pre-investment level for the period following his or her admis-sion as a conditional permanent resi-dent. Such evidence may include pay-roll records, relevant tax documents, and Forms I–9.'),\n",

Yes. When you submit your applicati on, you will be given a date and time for a “Type I \\nReview Conference”. At this conference you will get  to personally meet with your \\nPlanner and, depending upon  the scope of your project, y ou may also meet with a staff \\nengineer, a Public Works eng ineer, a Deputy Fire Marsha l, a Sheriff’s Deputy, a \\nBuilding Inspector or Plans Examiner, or a staff member from the Southwest \\nWashington Health District. As the applicant this conference affords you the opportunity to present your proposal \\nand plans to the staff. For staff, the conf erence offers an opportunity to ask questions, \\ngive guidance, and to ensure the applicant  clearly understands the process and \\nregulations, as they will be affecting them. By the end of the conference, you as the applicant will know whether your project will be approved, approved with c onditions, denied, OR, what additional information the staff \\nwill need before they can make a decision. (Your project wi ll be placed on hold if \\nadditional information is required.)  \\nHow does the Type I Site Plan review process work? The County conducts two application checks to ensure that applications are complete \\nbefore staff begins their development review pr ocess. Prior to accepting an application, \\nthe Permit Services staff will conduct a “ Counter Complete\\n“ review of the submittal \\npackage. This initial Counter Complete review ensur es that all required  submittal items are \\ncontained within the package. If each item on the submitta l requirement list has been \\nsubmitted, the application will be accepted for further review . To be Counter Complete, \\nthe following items must be submitted:  1. Cover Sheet & Table of Contents 2. Application Form 3. Application Fee 4. Developer’s GIS Packet Information 5. Narrative 6. Authorization to use Site & Support Structure 7. Legal Lot Determination Information 8. Proposed Site Plan 9.'),\n",

This detailed review ensures that  all items submitted have the technical \\ninformation required for staff to make a decision. If the application is “Fully Complete” the staff has until the Type I Conference date to review the application.

Data and information are presented for the period 1992 through 1996. The\\nsummary is organized into four main sections: U.S. industry profile, U.S. market, U.S. trade,\\nand foreign industry profile. The U.S. industry profile section describes the industry\\nstructure,  manufacturing methods, and regulatory factors. The U.S. market section provides\\ninformation  on domestic consumption and production of these products and consumer\\ncharacterist ics and factors affecting demand. The segment on U.S. trade includes data on\\nU.S. import and export levels, the trade balance, principal suppliers, and U.S. and foreign\\ntrade  measures. The foreign industry profile section provides information on major world\\nmanufacturers  of these products. In addition, an appendix provides an explanation of current\\ntariff  and trade agreements terms used in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States\\n(HTS). The products and data covered herein do not include those products intended for use\\nby the U.S. military establishment.1\\nDomestic  shipments of the products covered in this summary — explosives, propellant\\npowders, and related items — increased by about 12.8 percent2 from less than $1.5 billion in\\n1992  to nearly $1.7 billion by the end of 1994. After decreasing to about $1.6 billion in 1995,\\nsales rose to almost $1.8 billion in 1996. This represents an average annual increase during\\n1992-96 of about 4.9 percent. All of the products covered in this summary are explosive or rapid-burning products that\\nutilize  the heat, pressure, and/or light generated in their application to accomplish their desired\\nfunction. These groupings encompass a wide variety of products, including prepared\\nexplosives  such as dynamite, trinitrotoluene (TNT), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN),\\nazides,  and other high explosives; propellant powders such as black powder, smokeless\\npowders, certain rocket fuels, and the like; fuses and detonators; fireworks; matches; signal\\nflares  and other signaling devices; spark-producing metal alloys; and a number of other\\npyrotechnic  articles. These products are manufactured using a variety of physical and\\nchemical  processes incorporating a number of raw materials into the final product. They are\\nprincipally  used in commercial and industrial applications in mining, quarrying, well drilling,\\nconstru ction and demolition industries, agriculture, and a number of metal working and\\nmetallurgical  applications. In addition, many products (e.g., dynamite, smokeless powder,\\nblack  powder, fireworks, flares, signaling devices, cigarette lighter flints, matches, and many\\nothers) are also used by private consumers. Ammonium  nitrate-fuel oil (ANFO) blasting agents3 represent the largest industrial explosive\\nmanufactured  (in terms of quantity) in the United States. This product is used primarily in'),\n",

The components  are generally mixed at or near the point\\nof use for safety reasons. The mixed product is relatively safe and easily handled and can be\\npoured into drill holes in the mass or object to be blasted. Dynamites  and other prepared high explosives are also used in mining and quarrying\\noperations,  as well as in construction, land clearing for agricultural use, and demolition\\noperations. They are usually shipped packaged in a finished condition and do not require\\nadditional  mixing at the point of use. They are generally safe to handle and ship when\\nreasonable care is taken to avoid exposure to excess heat or shock. In use, a blasting cap,\\nelectric  detonator, or some other type of initiator is generally needed to fire these types of high\\nexplosives. The largest sources of U.S. imports of these products  are Canada and Sweden,\\nwhile Saudi Arabia, Canada, and Venezuela are the principal markets for U.S. exports. Propellant  powders include principally smokeless powder and black powder. Smokeless\\npowder4 is usually nitrocellulose with a nitrogen content of about 13.1 percent. The\\nnitrocellulose is made into a dough using an alcohol-ether mixture. Various plasticizers and\\nother modifiers are sometimes added in small amounts.'),\n",

Some is also used in fireworks and\\nother  pyrotechnic articles. Black powder is a mixture of potassium nitrate, charcoal, and\\nsulfur. It is used in  black powder firearms and certain blasting operations. The amount of\\nsmoke produced is very high relative to that of smokeless powder. The largest source of U.S. imports  of these products is Canada, while Israel, Canada, and Mexico are the main markets\\nfor U.S. exports. Fireworks  are made using a variety of methods and each type is designed to produce specific\\neffects. The effects are a combination of the light and/or sound produced by the combustion\\nof the explosive and various other ingredients. The combustion is usually initiated by the\\napplication  of a heat source. Fireworks accounted for the largest part of U.S. imports of\\nexplosives  materials (about 41 percent by value) in 1996. Most of the U.S. imports of these\\nproducts (mainly fireworks) come from China. Matches  are pyrotechnic articles manufactured by coating one end of a paper or wooden stick\\nwith a combustible compound consisting principally of phosphorus. The compound is\\ndesigned to ignite when a certain level of heat is supplied by friction in the process of striking. There  are a variety of sizes and types of matches. Wooden stemmed matches, used primarily\\nto light fires in fireplaces, stoves, etc., are packaged and sold in boxes or tubes. Paper\\nstemmed  matches are generally packaged in books. Since the covers of these books are often\\nused as advertisements, many book matches are given away as promotional items. The major\\nuse of book matches is in the igniting of tobacco products. Canada, Japan, and Sweden\\nsupply  the majority of U.S. imports of these products, while Canada is the destination for\\nmost U.S. exports.'),\n",

During 1992-96, the output per production worker hour\\n(productivity)  is estimated to have increased slightly. Wage rates for production workers in\\nthis industry are estimated by industry analysts9 to have increased by about 3 to 5 percent\\nannually  during the same period, from estimated average hourly earnings of about $14.12 in\\n1992  to about $16.71 in 1996. Many of the production workers in this industry are employed\\non a seasonal basis, particularly those workers employed in the manufacture of certain\\nfireworks. Payroll is estimated by industry observers10 to amount to about 27 to 30  percent\\nof the value of shipments; raw material costs are estimated to account for about 32 to 36\\npercent  of sales; other production costs, general administrative and selling expenses, and\\nprofits account for the remainder. Manufacturing Methods\\nThe explosives, propellant powders, initiating devices, fireworks, and other pyrotechnic\\nproducts  that are described in this summary are manufactured utilizing a variety of chemical\\nreactions in  facilities ranging in operations from complex automated processes to relatively\\nsimple  mixing of ingredients at the point of use. While there are a large number of ingredients\\nthat could be used to manufacture the products this summary covers, many of them are either\\ntoo sensitive to meet safe handling requirements during production, storage, and shipment, or\\nthey are too expensive to permit use in the manufacture of a cost-competitive product. Therefore,  the majority of the products that are covered here are manufactured from a fairly\\nsmall number of time-tested and proven materials using well-known and understood processes\\nand methods. These ingredients are used in processes that  are rigidly controlled to produce\\na quality product in a safe production environment.

These regulations influence the industry\\nprocesses  and production costs, and thus affect business operations and investment decisions. Most  research and development funds are directed either toward cost-cutting or toward\\nregulat ory compliance. This industry must meet many stringent standards and regulations for\\nhealth and safety for every facet of the manufacturing, handling, shipping, and storage of these\\nproducts. The members of the industry state that they work very closely, both individually\\nand through various trade associations, with local, State, and Federal Government agencies\\nto ensure the safe manufacture and use of these materials. The principal Federal agencies that\\nregulate  this industry include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the U.S. Bureau  of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the U.S. Department of Transportation, the\\nEnvironmental  Protection Agency, and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. According\\nto industry  trade associations, various State and local governments also impose regulations. Examples  of Federal laws related to environmental hazards that apply to this industry include\\nthe Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource\\nConservation and Recovery Act, and the Superfund legislation.11\\nU.S. MARKET\\nConsumer Characteristics and Factors Affecting Demand 12\\nThe principal consumers are the mining (particularly coal mining) industries, quarrying\\noperations,  construction firms, and civilian munitions industries.13  Together these markets\\nconsume  more than 75 percent of all the products of the explosives, propellant powders, and\\nrelated  items industry segment covered in this summary. Other markets for these products\\ninclude  the agriculture industry and the general public. The markets for these products are\\nnationwide,  although the majority of the explosives and related items covered herein are used\\nin various mining operations (particularly coal mining operations) in both the eastern and\\nwestern mountain regions.14'),\n",

The domestic demand for these products is principally\\nderived  from the demand for the mined or quarried raw materials used in power generation\\n(coal)  and a wide variety of downstream industrial and consumer products (e.g., metals,\\npigments,  gems, gravel). U.S. industrial demand generally tracks the trends exhibited by the\\ngeneral economy. It is most strongly affected by changes in demand for electrical power and\\nconstruction. In addition,  some products (e.g., fireworks, black powder) are sold directly to\\nprivate  individuals for such things as stump and rock removal in connection with land\\nclearing, holiday celebrations, revolutionary war, civil war, and other war battle reenactments,\\nhunting,  and other forms of recreational activities. According to industry analysts, the overall\\nlevel of demand in this market segment is most affected by changes in the level of disposable\\nincome available to the general public. Consumption\\nThe overall trend for U.S. apparent consumption of explosives, propellant powders, and\\nrelated items was generally upward at an estimated average annual rate of about 3 percent\\nfrom less than $1.5 billion in 1992 to over 1.6 billion in 1996 (table 1 and figure 2).

Other data are\\nestimated  by the staff of the U.S. International Trade Commission based on official U.S. Government statistics and\\ninterviews with industry representatives. The value  of U.S. apparent consumption in 1992 was the lowest during the five-year period\\nunder  discussion. This value, however, despite being about 24 percent lower than the\\nprevious year, reflects traditional market levels. In 1991, U.S. apparent consumption of\\nexplosives,  propellant powders, and related items grew significantly, primarily because of an\\nincrease  in coal mining in response to the Persian Gulf War in that year. As the cost of crude\\npetroleum  increased during the Persian Gulf War, many consumers switched from petroleum\\nto coal for fuel and power generation. The resulting increased demand for coal and coal\\nproducts  fueled a corresponding increase in demand for explosives and related items by the\\ncoal industry. In addition, because ANFO-based blasting mixtures represent approximately\\n98 percent, by weight, of total domestic consumption of all industrial explosives,15 and the\\nprice of the fuel oil consumed in the manufacture of these products increased, the price of\\nthese  products also increased. During 1992, several months after the Gulf War ended, the\\nmarket  prices of crude petroleum on the world market stabilized and declined somewhat, and\\nthe concern about  the security and stability of the crude petroleum supply from the Persian\\nGulf region abated. As a result, coal production in the U.S. fields fell back closer to their\\nnormal  levels in 1992, and, in response to these market forces, so did domestic demand for the\\ntypes of explosives and related items used by that industry.16'),\n",

Column 1-general rates of duty for countries considered for most-favored-\\nnation  (MFN) treatment range from zero to 6.9 percent ad valorem on imports of these\\nproducts. In most cases the rate of duty charged by foreign countries on U.S. products is\\nconsiderably  higher than the U.S. rate of duty charged on imports of similar goods. For\\nexample, the United States imposes a duty rate of 5.3 percent ad valorem on imports of\\nfireworks  from all most-favored nations, which includes China.

In June 1991, the Commission made\\nan affirmative final determination under the U.S. antidumping law with respect to imports of\\nsparklers  (a type of fireworks) from China.21  This affirmative determination followed\\nnotification  by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) that it had found that such\\nsparklers  imported from China were being sold in the United States at less than fair value.22\\nAs a result of the Commission\\'s affirmative determination, Commerce issued an antidumping\\norder  covering sparklers imported from China. Under the order, imports of sparklers from\\nChinese firms are assessed  additional duties, the amount of which is based on Commerce’s\\ncalcu lated margins of unfair underselling. The Chinese firm of Guangxi Native Produce\\nImport  and Export Company was subject to an antidumping duty of 41.75 percent ad valorem\\nin addition to the regular \"General\" rate of duty charged on imports of these products. U.S. imports  of sparklers from all other Chinese manufacturers of fireworks were subject to an\\nantidumping  duty of 93.54 percent ad valorem in addition to the regular \"General\" rate of duty\\ncharged  on U.S. imports of these products.23  The most recent U.S. Department of Commerce\\nreview of the order was undertaken beginning in late 1994. On July 30, 1996, the U.S. Department  of Commerce announced that it had determined the country-wide dumping margin\\nto be 93.54 percent, including imports of sparklers from Guangxi Native Produce Import and\\nExport Company.24 \\nU.S. Exports\\nPrincipal Markets and Export Levels\\nTotal  U.S. exports of explosives, propellant powders, and related items increased from about\\n$212  million in 1992 to nearly $328 million in 1996, representing an average annual increase\\nof approximately 11.6 percent. Table 5 ranks U.S. exports of these products by principal\\ndestination  based on the value of 1996 exports. Canada, because of its proximity, large\\nmining  operations, and relatively high level of industrialization, has historically been the\\nlargest  foreign market for U.S. exports of these products, a trend that continued during 1992-\\n96. Exports of these products to Canada amounted to about $96 million in 1996, representing\\nmore  than 29 percent of all such exports. Most of the U.S. products exported to Canada are\\nconsumed  in the mining, quarrying, and construction industries.

The major competitors of U.S. firms in the global market are\\ncompanies  located in Canada, China, Japan, and  the European Union (EU). According to\\nindustry  analysts, these countries have industries that have developed to a level similar to that\\nof the United States in terms of capital, research and development, production technology, raw\\nmaterial  and labor availability, product variety, and marketing ability. In addition, the levels\\nof both horizontal and vertical integration of foreign  firms in the industrialized countries are\\nsimilar  to those of companies located in the United States.26  In the less industrialized countries\\nthe range of products available tends to be smaller and usually contains less of the higher-\\nvalued  high-tech products.

These commitments may include supplemental fees and charges \\nthat are in addition to the rates described herein, if both the disposal site operator \\nand the generator agree to such charges and if such charges are necessary in order to cover all operating costs and obligations. The binding commitments \\nshall preclude the need [as described in 48-46-40(D)(2), South Carolina Code of \\nLaws] to withdraw funds from the Barnwell Extended Care Fund to cover shortfalls in the event that overall disposal revenues are not adequate to cover \\noperating costs and obligations. To be eligible for Option B pricing, a waste \\ngenerator must submit a copy of such binding agreement to the South Carolina \\nEnergy Office not later than close of business, July 1, 2008\\n. NOTES: \\nA. Surcharges for the extended care fund and decommissioning trust fund are included in the \\ndisposal rates . B. Irradiated hardware and high dose shipments:  As a general rule, case-by-case billing as \\nirradiated hardware pertains to shipments of except ionally high activity that require clearing of the \\nsite and special off-loading into a slit trench . These generally include CNS3-55, TN-RAM, and \\nother horizontally offloaded cask shipments. In  addition to items of irradiated hardware, if a \\nshipment requires substantial sp ecial handling, due to exceptionally high package surface doses, \\nadditional surcharges may be authorized by Board staff in an amount that will reimburse the site \\noperator for costs that have not been budgeted. C. Large components:  Pricing will be calculated on a case-by-case basis in an amount sufficient to \\ncover all additional operating costs incurred by the site operator to dispose of the waste. Large \\ncomponents include steam generators,  reactor pressure vessels, reactor coolant pumps, or items \\nthat require construction of special-sized disp osal vaults. Large components also include items \\nthat may fit into the standard sized vault, but fi t so inefficiently due to their shape and geometry \\nthat it is less costly to build  a specially sized vault. Because the disposal of large components is rare and is not considered as a factor in planning \\nand budgeting for site operations, a reasonable suppl emental service fee may be authorized by \\nBoard staff to cover the disposal site operat or’s costs for planning, consultation, feasibility \\nstudies, cost estimating, regulatory consultati on, and other necessary costs that have not been \\nbudgeted and accounted for as operating costs for the fiscal year. This supplemental service fee \\nis applicable whether or not the generator ultimately commits to disposal of the large \\ncomponent(s), and whether or not the waste is eventually disposed at the Barnwell site. Because the operating costs for disposal of lar ge components may be significantly affected by the \\nnumber of such components and the schedule for del ivery, generators are strongly encouraged to \\ncoordinate their plans for shipment of large com ponents to Barnwell in order to reduce unit costs \\nthrough better economies of scale. Early in project planning, shippers are encouraged to consult \\nwith the disposal site operator on designs and configurations that may reduce handling and \\noffloading costs at the disposal site. D. Transport vehicles with additional shielding features may be subject to an additional handling fee \\nwhich will be provided upon request. E. In certain circumstances, the disposal site operator may assess additional charges for necessary \\nservices that are not part of and are additional to  disposal rates established by the State of South \\nCarolina. These include decontamination servic es and special services as described in the \\nBarnwell Site Disposal Criteria. F.'),\n",

American taxpayers are quite interested in knowing how banks have used the money that Treasury has invested under the \\nCapital Purchase Program (CPP) and Community Development Capital Initiative (CDCI). To answer that question, Treasury is seeking responses that describe generally how the CPP/CDCI investment has affected the operation of your business. We understand that once received, the cash associated with TARP funding is indistinguishable from other cash sources, unless the funds were segregated, and therefore it may not be feasible to identify precisely how the CPP/CDCI investment was deployed or how many CPP/CDCI dollars were allocated to each use. Nevertheless, we ask you to provide as much information as you can about how you have used the capital Treasury has provided, and how your uses of that capital have changed over time. Treasury will be pairing this survey with a summary of certain balance sheet and other financial data from your institution's regulatory filings, so to the extent you find it helpful to do so, please feel free to refer to your institution's quarterly ca ll reports to \\nillustrate your answers. This is your opportunity to speak to the taxpayers in your own words, which will be posted on our website. What specific ways did your institution utilize CPP/CDCI capital? Check all that apply and elaborate as appropriate, especiall y if \\nthe uses have shifted over time. Your responses should reflect actions taken over the past year (or for the portion of the yea r in \\nwhich CPP/CDCI funds were outstanding). Increase lending or reduce lending less than otherwise would have occurred. To the extent the funds supported increased lending, please describe the major type of loans, if possible (residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans, small business loans, etc.).
